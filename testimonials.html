                	<h3> Miraculous Recovery of hearing loss </h3>
            	<p>Aatma Namaste Mathiji,<br><br>


My family and I went for a holiday to Bali, Indonesia last summer where I did a scuba diving certified course, among other water sports. It was an idyllic holiday where I took extra precautions related to the water sports and we were all fine. I think it's also important to add here that I was very physically fit and healthy at that point. 
<br><br>
On the flight back, due to some unknown reason, my right ear started getting blocked and after the two flights that I had to take to reach Chennai, I had a complete block on the right side. I was unperturbed and went to my ENT physician the next morning, thinking it was some wax or water that had blocked it. To my dismay, I was told that I had suffered from Sudden Sensorial Hearing Loss ( SSHL)  which is similar to a stroke in the inner ear ear and it was most probably a permanent loss... if I were lucky, I would retrieve my hearing partially 9 (anywhere between 20 - 40%) but it may not happen at all. Hospitalisation, intravenous steroid medication, audiometry tests, MRI and CAT scans, secondary opinions from other ENT doctors - all took over my life and the following 10 days were very difficult with no hearing at all.  
There after, I got back 20% hearing but it did not improve any further. It was at this point that a dear friend, Garima Agarwal, asked me to receive Pranic Healing. To cut  along story short, I was introduced to Mr. Mathimaran for my first pranic healing session in mid June, 2014. 
<br><br>

Mathiji healed me of my hearing loss in one pranic healing session!
<br><br>

It was a miracle as far as my family and I were concerned. At this first ever pranic healing session, Mathiji healed me for an hour during which I experienced subtle yet very vivid reactions; he guided me through the process very gently and by the end of the session, I was so happy and relieved - I felt lighter, positive, there was no pressure in my head and I could hear clearly with my right ear!! After the healing, I went directly for an audiometry test to check - and it showed that I had got back more than 85% of my hearing in the affected ear.
<br><br>

The medicines continued even after but the major breakthrough occurred through Mathiji's healing and I am ever grateful to him for that and for being my guide and teacher in Pranic Healing, eversince.

                	<h3> Migraine cured </h3>
            	<p>Atma Namaste!!<br><br>

Last year ( March 2015) I attended a Crystal Healing Class.<br>
During the class Mathiji requested for a volunteer who had any kind of back pain.<br>
I volunteered as a few months ago I had developed a slight back pain.<br>
When I stepped on stage Mathiji scanned my chakras and his exact words to the class was "Wow !!!! This girl needs help."<br>
He apologized to the class and told them that he would need to deviate from what he intended to demonstrate (I was clueless about what Mathiji was referring too)<br>
He continued to scan my chakras further and said this to the class......<br>
" This Girl has been in pain for such a long time that she has has become used to it. It's just like she wore a helmet of pain and never removed it and now she has forgotten about it.<br>
Tears began to trickle down my cheeks as I slowly realized what Mathiji was referring to.
<br><br>
With Grand Masters blessing and the Healing Angels and Healing ministers blessings,  Mathiji began to work on my chakras and after a while I felt a powerful release of tension in an upward movement from my tailbone all the way up to my crown.<br>
 Once Mathiji was done he asked me to share my experienced with the class . It's only then that I shared with everyone about my pain. I had been suffering from persistent migraines since the age of 8, Which was almost like 30 plus years. As time passed by I began to get used it. The frequency could be as high a every single day of the week or month.<br>
Popping painkillers was something I did every day. I would wake up in the morning with a migraine and just pop in a painkiller and go about my day. As I grew older the migraine attacks intensified and I had to resort to the more powerful nerve relaxers at one point the doctor also prescribed me with anti depressants ( however I chose not to take them)<br>
Migraines usually have triggers like food or temperatures or lack of sleep. Mine however never needed a reason . It was always around like a best friend.
I further shared with the class the feeling I had  as Mathiji healed me. It felt like a pipe being unclogged,  almost similar to a " A Drainpipe unclogging advertisement on television"
It's just that for me it was a movement from down to up. I Was happy to be healed but I didn't think much about it.<br>
A month passed by and  I attended another class by Mathiji and shared with him and the class how my migraine  episodes have reduced.
<br><br>
Now almost a year later , I did a Review of Crystal Healing class. I once again got to share my beautiful experience with Mathiji and the Class. To me it's a Miracle.
<br><br>
" With Grand Master Chwa Kok Sui's blessing and the Blessing of all spiritual elders and all the great ones and Mathiji , I have been almost completely cured of my persistent migranes "
<br><br>
If a few years ago someone would have told me that such a thing is possible I would have laughed at that person because I alone knew the  pain I endured all these years.
Today I am a believer .
<br><br>
Thank You Grand Master Chao Kok Sui and Mathiji I feel blessed.

                	<h3> Wonderful healing of Avaan's eye</h3>
            	<p>Atma Namaste!!<br><br>

I am Shreya Jain from Kolkata. I have been following Pranic Healing for more then 3 years now but the thing that happened with me some time back had made me an ardent admirer of Grand Master and his preachings forever. I had one of the most wonderful and miraculous experience of healing with my son last year.  My son who was then 6 months old was healed by Mathiji for the squint in his left eye. His Pediatrician had told me that this usually happens when the muscle of the eye is weak which leads to improper alignment and in most cases it eventually goes away on its own by the time the child is 10 months - 12 months. In some rare cases, this requires the help of exercises and medical surgery if not recovered on it own. His Right eye was absolutely normal. 
<br><br>
I was really worried about this and didn't know what to do. Then on one of the visits of Mathiji to Kolkata , I told him about this problem and he started the healing immediately . I was awestruck that while he was healing, my son's eye was 60% better and in just two days , his eye was totally normal. No squint at all. He just healed once. 
<br><br>
My son is now 15 months and till date I have never noticed any problem with his left eye alignment. 
<br><br>
My husband and I are extremely thankful to Mathiji for this miraculous healing and regard him with whole heart and soul. We recommend Pranic Healing to all our family and friends and we are also attending the Retreat that is happening in Kolkata in February 2017.

            	<p>This is to inform that I,Sanjeev Mundhra aged 42 years was suffering from acute neck pain and was 
            		under medication but there was no relief. 
					I called up Nehaji who further guided me to take healing from Shreya Agarwal .
					</p>
					<p>	After first healing of about 40 min i was feeling relaxed but after sometime the pain came back
						 though the intensity was less and after the second healing it was like there was no pain at 
						 all. What i understood from my discussion with Shreya is there was a lot of stress bcoz of my 
						 work so it created a negative energy which was bothering me ........just after 2 healing it 
						 was gone .....fantastic work Shreya !! </p>
						 <p>Keep helping the society to lead a better life without medication.</p>

                	<p>My boss introduced me to Neha Jain of GMCKS Lightworkers Trust. Since the introduction and consistent 
                		practice of Pranic Healing, it has had a significant impact on my ability to think on my feet and get 
                		a good grasp of any situation. The decision making speed has gone up tremendously and this has 
                		contributed a lot to my output both professionally and personally. </p>
                	<p>I have become more energetic and enthusiastic by simply following few of the techniques that I 
                		have learned in the healing sessions. 
 
                	 </p>
            	
					<p>Having a pranic healing session is probably the best way to encourage lasting change

					<p>Things have not been the same for me as before. Pranic Healing has changed a lot of ways of my living. 
						I have learnt to be positive  in life and come over my weakness.
						I have learnt how to change habits, and keep a control over myself. Twin heart's meditation makes me feel
						 lighter and relaxed. I would love to continue with my further courses and recommend others.

                <p>Hi Neha,</p>

				<p>Please find below my testimonial based on changes what i felt in me:</p>
				<p>There was a day when a well-wisher of mine introduced me to Pranik Group and i got aware of Prana world. 
					I did basic course and then started some practices and meditation which i did initially with intention yet 
					later on it get into my system. It uplifted my self esteem, my self confidence and a strong belief in what 
					i do, which opened new ways not only professionally yet personally as well.
				</p>
				<p>But as we all know bad Pranas attract us more powerfully and i got distracted. And then one day i remembered
					 a session i attended regarding "Power of right Motives!" and from that day i am a no looking back person. 
					 There is a long way to go yet i believe i will make my journey more interesting and learning with the 
					 guidance of Supreme God and Grand Master and by doing good Karmas.
				</p>
				<p>Living and experiencing all the moments of journey is more meaningful then reaching the destination.</p>
				<p>Thank you Supreme God thank you Grand Master </p>

				<h3>Experience from Basic Pranic Healing Class - Jindal Steel, Odisha</h3>
				<p>Dear Madam,</p>
				<p>We attended two days session during 25th &amp; 26th July’2015 at JSPL,Angul(Odisha) on 
					“ BASIC PRANIC HEALING”, trained by you. It was an altogether new learning and experience. We never knew 
					that our own body is a “POWER HUB” and learned how to use “ENERGY” from within our own body to “HEAL” 
					ourselves and others.</p>
				<p>“SCANNING” of living &amp; non-living orgasms, was nothing less than a “MAGICAL EXPERIENCE”. <br>
				Different ways of “HEALING“ proved "FRUITFUL”.<br>
					Sharing of knowledge about sources of various “DISEASES” and their “REMEDIES” was quite interesting. </p>
				<p>“MEDITATION” has always been an integral part of my life in a different format, but “MEDITATION TECHNIQUE” 
					taught by you, added flavor to my “LIFE” since yesterday.<br>
				“MORAL” spread through the “SCIENCE OF KARMA” was “WORTH LEARNING &amp; ADOPTING IN ONE’S LIFE”. <br>
  				<span>“ABOVE ALL EVERY TEACHING WAS SCIENTIFICALLY AND LOGICALLY PROVEN”. </span>

				<p>Last, but not the least I would like to extend my sincere thanks to Shri Murty Sir,for considering me and his

                	<p>Dear GMCKS LIghtworkers Team,</p>
                	<p>Let us start by humbly thanking Grand Master who has blessed us with this unique gift of Pranic Healing.
                	 Pranic Healing for me and my family has just not meant getting cured of ailments, but has in fact been a ready 
                	 reckoner for us to be able to live life which is Karmically correct and fulfilling. 
                	 </p>
            	
					<p>Being involved in Pranic for the past 2 years, when we heard that even companies/businesses 
						could be healed we were eager to get healing done for our company. Running a logistics firm 
						for the past 5 years we had been facing the brunt of recession for the last year or so. 
						We decided to move a portion of our fleet (approx 50 trucks to be moved) from Southern India 
						to Gujarat where we had taken up fresh work. When we were planning this move we started facing 
						driver unrest and Unionism threats bordering on militancy. I discussed these concerns with Neha 
						Bhabhi (Neha Jain) and she told me that the healers assigned to my company would remove these 
						negative emotions from the aura of the drivers and bless them. One month into regular healing 
						all 50 trucks moved to Gujarat without any incident, thanks to Masters blessings and the 
						constant efforts of the healers.</p>
                    <p>Another example wherein we benefited was that we were having a 5% transport allocation 
                    	of Finished Goods at the plant where we had commenced operations. I discussed this with Mayuri 
                    	(Healer handling my company) and told her that I wanted this allocation to increase. A week later one 
                    	of the transporters at the plant left for some reasons and their allocation was transferred to us, 
                    	pushing up our transport share from  5% to 18% of production. </p>
                    <p>I could go on and on but suffice it to say that we feel blessed to have been somehow involved with 
                    	this beautiful vision of Grand Master.</p>
                    <p>Our testimonial would not be complete without heartfelt gratitude towards Neeraj Bhaiya 
                    	(Neeraj Jain) and Neha Bhabhi who have motivated, guided and healed us ( our family and our 
                    	company) on countless occasions and have helped inculcate a deep rooted belief in the 
                    	wonders of this system of healing energies.</p>

                	<h3>Soul Class</h3>
                	<p>It was two days of knowing oneself, realization of who I am and the purpose of life. Lot of questions were
answered and a lot more popped up during the class which I am still wondering and trying to figure out
answers.</p>
					<p>Neha during the class on Tuesday you had asked a simple question that we all want happiness but do we
know what will give us happiness and I am still trying to find a suitable answer for the same.</p>
                    <p>We have come to know about the energy world, about the law of Karma. Mind balancing techniques and
                    meditation of connecting with the higher soul was practised and taught.</p>
                    <p>Thank you Neha for your guidance to the world of energy, karma and knowing oneself. It has given me a
                    new direction to think about in life. I recommend the soul class and Pranic healing to all my BNI friends and
                    family. It would be a life changing experience.</p>

                	<p>Dearest Neha,<br>
                    It was our (Mona &amp; myself) privilege to have undergone the 2 day Basic Pranic Healing workshop
                    Undertaken by you on 20th &amp; 21st December 2014.</p>
					<p>We truly enjoyed every moment of it. Where in you taught us how to heal oneself from diseases And also
how to heal others. Further you taught us how to be better human beings following the principles of Karma
which teach us that “what we sow we reap the same fruits”.</p>
					<p>I strongly recommend our entire BNI family to take advantage of this beautiful course and change the course
of their lives forever.</p>
					<p>Thank you Neha once again.
Warm Regards</p>

                	<h3>Basic Class</h3>
                    <p>Myself Pankaj Maloo, CEO of Kreative Fingers. Company specializing in both Graphic &amp; Web
designing and having clients worldwide. I always believe in the supreme power, law of karma</p>
<p>And givers gain philosophy. I was still searching for a path or guidance which can help me
understand them more. While I was still searching the path and guidance I happened to meet Neha.</p>
<p>Thanks to Manoj for inviting her to our BNI meetings, and to our leadership team in assigning me as
her mentor for BNI. On the first instance I met her we discussed about Pranic healing. I somehow felt
that I should be attending this course to understand more about this ideology and school of thought.
But to be honest I was still in two minds. Then Neha came to our office and we discussed a bit more
about Pranic healing. Then even I spoke to Manoj about the same and decided to enrol myself, three
of my office colleagues and my wife to attend the basic course.</p>
<p>The experience that I had was amazing. I was feeling calm inside. She answered all of my questions I
had about the spiritual world. Law of Karma was discussed in detail and gives me more reason to
believe in the same. I have learnt a technique of forgiveness which really makes me feel so light
inside. Apart from that she taught us healing techniques.</p>
<p>I personally thank you Neha from the bottom of my heart for being the channel, the instrument of
the Master by helping and guiding us in the path of happiness and a more peaceful life.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

Thank you for enlightening me and my wife with the very positive approach of pranic healing
And it has truly helped me to shape into a more mature person !!</p>
<p>Being the founder of Onex Solutions Pvt Ltd. I always love to see my company logo on every Banner,

Enhance my Onex team spirit by learning in Pranic healing on building good relationships.</p>
<p>Your session was very rejuvenating and full of life and positive hopes. Your personal attention to
help me learn the techniques of cleansing and revitalizing is commendable.</p>
<p>You have imbibed in us and made us believe in your thoughts that Pranic healing is really an
effective tool to help “heal” homes, businesses, bank accounts and family friction. You also
introduced us to the “Law of Karma” which provides us with apt answers to all our unanswered
questions hidden deep inside. I would recommend my friends to try this power pack session of
PRANIC HEALING. Your sincere efforts to solve our health issues or valuable advice through the tool
of pranic healing. Do not panic coz there is Pranic to heal you. !!</p>

                    <p>What I have received from Pranic Healing is a long list, but the one thing that is truly close
to my heart is the awareness that the actual root cause for some of my circumstances were
my own “emotional setbacks”. The Twin hearts meditation during my 1st Basic class was
life transforming. The forgiveness technique practised therein helped me overcome my
emotional turmoil and I gradually realized and understood my area of setback, and was able
to work towards it.</p>

                    <p>I was suffering from something called “Spiritual Emptiness”. Everything that I was doing
did not give me any joy or inner peace. After asking several questions to myself, everything
around seemed meaningless. After doing Pranic Healing and especially Arhatic Yoga,
something changed within me. I started feeling more joyous and happy and got answers to
many questions . In other words I felt as if I have found my home.</p>
